## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

NOTE: I did not attempt to recreate the exact paddings and margins I had in the JPG file. Instead, my main focus was just getting the responsive layouts right.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid with grid areas
- Mobile-first workflow
- Responsive units so that the page is usable when zoomed in or when the browser font size is set to 32

### What I learned

How to use grid template areas.

I also tested the page with different zoom levels and default font sizes in the browser settings, so that it would be made accessible to people who prefer larger font sizes. With large font sizes, the layout switches to mobile.

### Continued development

Things to focus on:

 - Consistent style names
 - Planning the containers in advance before writing CSS
 - Learning how to adapt pages to screenreaders
 - Making a media query that will adapt the page to being printed out.
